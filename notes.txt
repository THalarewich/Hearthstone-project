USER INPUT FIELDS
General:
    - allow user to click the submit buttons as well use the 'enter' key
    - had one instance where new terms of service needed to be agreed to for BN and then after agreeing the redirect
        url did not work
    - maybe make a guest account with a guest Battle.net account for everything to be tested out.

IN APP.PY 
requirments.txt
- may need to remake file? not sure if more reqirements have been added?
General
    * when someone clicks on nav links before signing in, it will bring them to that page without signin 
    then proceed to have JS errors (Probably best to just disable the links from anypage where someone wouldn't be 
        signed in)
    (need to make it impossible for user to visit those pages before signin)
    * need some error handling in place to get user to link battle.net account before using either the 
    builder or match game
/profile
    * what if user has never played match game, what will be displayed for match PB on profile page
    * if 'Any Class' is selected by the radio buttons make sure sql will return decks of any class not nothing
    * matchPB cannot compare float and str (saved a float in the match.js instead of a str)
/match
    - had strange issue with serializing and parsing JSON had to do a funky work around to make it work
/api_call
    * need error handling if user did not link battle.net account yet
/delete
    * need some error handling for if the deck selected does not exist
    * need to do something with the response code in JS to notify user (timed popup from CSS)
/builder
    * check if deck name was already used by user
/api_search
    - check_expiry

IN MATCH.JS
    * when you match 2 cards and click on a 3rd while the first two are still on the screen, the 3rd card will 
    disappear with the 2 matched cards, making it impossible to complete the game
    * if 2 cards are flipped and don't match then a 3rd is flipped while the first two are still showing then all 
    3 will flip back face down
    * fixed issue above but it caused a new issue, if you click on a third as soon as you can after the first 2 flip 
    face down, then the 3rd will flip facedown when you click on a 4th too quickly
    - error handling for fetch request incase there is an issue with the server returning the cards
    (not sure if this is needed as the shuffle button won't show up unless the deck is filled)

IN PROFILE.JS
    * after deleting a deck make the page refresh the returned decks on displayed
    * radio button 'Any Class' doesnt return anything atm
    - grab error element and if empty (do something to make the layout not awkward)

IN BUILDER.JS
    - ***when i made 1 deck, saved it, deleted all cards from said deck, the card counter was at 3 cards still even 
    though all cards were removed (cannot recreate problem)
    * if user clicks else where on the page while a drop down menu is open, make menu disappear
    if menu is down and user clicks to remove class then the menu stays open while all dropdown menu buttons disappear
    * html class "selected-card" is in use by the match game, causing cards in deck in builder to appear mirrored
    * In function selectedFilters() need to implement a popup window if the user clicks to remove the selected class
    notifying user that removing the class will remove all class specific cards and asks if they want to continue
    * some way to notify user that deck was saved
            (use message sent from flask to display a timed popup to let user know the deck was saved)
    * add button to clear the current choosen cards in current deck

    - In function apiSearch() i needed to use both .json() and JSON.parse() in order to convert json to a JS object
    but in every other fetch request in this app i had to only use .json() otherwise errors would arise??? why???

    - BUG after changing some of the CSS in line 220 in builder.js popUp prompt no longer removes the class when 
        you type yes into the command prompt
            you get error "Invalid left-hand side in assignment"
    - drop down menus for filters are off to the right side slightly
    - when class cards are added then removed with the filter reset, the total card count is off after the cards are 
        removed
CSS TODO NOTES
    - Watch videos on decktop vs mobile layout and make a cheat sheet on steps to lay everything out!!!!
    - Majority of console.log()/(commented 'popup') messages need to be converted to popup windows or messages for 
            user to select
    - 'X' on cards and decks will need to be turned into a button on the item to reference it being possible 
    to delete said item
    - ALL THE STYLES!
    - carousels for deck displays or another option?
    - how should match cards be layed out?
